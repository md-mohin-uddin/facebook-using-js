# Facebook-like Post Application

This is a simple Facebook-like post application built using **HTML**, **CSS**, **Bootstrap**, and **JavaScript** with **localStorage** for data persistence.

## Features

- **Create Post**: Users can write and submit posts, which will be displayed on the page.
- **Edit Post**: Users can edit their posts, and the updated content will be reflected in the post and saved in `localStorage`.

- **Like and Share**: Each post has like and share buttons, and counts for both are displayed.
- **Comment on Posts**: Users can comment on posts, and the number of comments will be updated dynamically.
- **Data Persistence**: Posts are saved in `localStorage`, so they will remain after page reloads.
